How to compile and run my program:
1. Ran by clicking the Green play button or (control+r) in the main.java class. For inputs, only use the format specified and capital letters matter (for game mode)

Any assumptions:
Flags don't have to be able to be removed like in the real game

Additional features:
Prints out the whole minefield once the game ends

Any known bugs:
None
